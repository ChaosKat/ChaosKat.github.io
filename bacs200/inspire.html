  <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
  <p>This is Technoblade, a Minecraft Youtuber and streamer who's been making videos since 2013.</p>
  <p>I'm sure that if I was writing this two years ago he'd need a lengthy introduction, but in that time he has risen into a strange Youtube fame brought in by the resurgance of
    Minecraft Youtubers. With this fame came an almost complete rebranding of his content into a form that I, to be blunt, do not enjoy nearly as much as his old videos.</p>
  <p>But despite this change, the moment I saw this assignment I knew I had to do it on Technoblade. How has this comedic Minecraft Youtuber managed to leave such an impact both
    on me, and his now millions of fans?</p>
  <h2>Technoblade's content</h2>
  <p>For most of his career, Technoblade has made videos almost exclusively on the Minecraft server Hypixel. While many of his old videos have been deleted, his still avaliable
    ones give a good idea of what his content was like in the early days. Hypixel was a much smaller network back then, and the biggest game there was called Blitz Survival
    Games, a PvP competition common on Minecraft servers back in the day, but Hypixel put its own unique spin on it with various classes and high quality original maps that made
    it quite popular.</p>
  <p>Technoblade was already experienced in PvP before starting his Youtube channel, due to having played on faction PvP servers which tended to attract a much more dedicated and
    skilled playerbase. From the moment his channel started these skills have been the focal point of his content, with almost all of his videos revolving around his victories and 
    achievements in Hypixel and, much later on, in large Minecraft tournaments and events. His focus on Hypixel combined with his skill is what created his early appeal, as both
    skilled Minecraft PvPers and single server channels were in low supply.</p>
  <p>But what made people stay wasn't his PvP skill, it was how he presented it. He's often quite confident in his gameplay and will joke about difficult fights such as 2v1s or
    hackers being easy, but he also knows when to be self depricating or show himself failing, often with him quickly denying said failure and trying to cover it up through video
    editing.
