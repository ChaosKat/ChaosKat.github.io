        <h1>Kiva Loans</h1>
        <h3>Change lives with just twenty-five dollars</h3>
        <p>Kiva allows people in poverty around the world to create businesses and follow their dreams through loans which are funded in $25 dollar increments by dozens of people. 
        This loan system allows the money to be recycled by the loaner, which can be seen in their massive funding to loaner ratio.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of Using Kiva</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kiva is careful to ensure that while many borrowers pay interest, this interest is reasonable and Field Partners are vetted to ensure they have both good intent and dedication to said intent</li>

            <li>The small initial investment allows for a wide range of people to contribute to funding loans</li>

            <li>By using a loan system going towards monitarily self sustaining goals, Kiva encourages its borrowers to be self sufficent and not have to rely on constant donations, being able to improve quality
            of life for both themselves and their families in the long term</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The easiest way to get involved with Kiva is to sign up and start funding loans. It's as simple as having an extra $25 dollars in the bank to start changing lives!</li>
            <li>Tell your friends! As Kiva's loans are group funded it's important for them to have a large amount of donaters, and every little bit helps.</li>
            <li>Keep track of your loans! If you forget to access Kiva then the money you're refunded will go to waste. Make sure to keep up to date with your funded loans so this doesn't happen!</li>
