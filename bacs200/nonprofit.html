    <h1>Kiva Loans</h1>
    <h3>Change lives with just twenty-five dollars</h3>
    <p>Kiva allows people in poverty around the world to create businesses and follow their dreams through loans which are funded in $25 dollar increments by dozens of people. 
    This loan system allows the money to be recycled by the loaner, which can be seen in their massive funding to loaner ratio.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kiva is careful to ensure that while many borrowers pay interest, this interest is reasonable and Field Partners are vetted to ensure they have both good intent and dedication to said intent</li>
        <li>The small initial investment allows for a wide range of people to contribute to funding loans</li>
        <li>By using a loan system going towards monitarily self sustaining goals, Kiva encourages its borrowers to be self sufficent and not have to rely on constant donations, being able to improve quality
        of life for both themselves and their families in the long term</li>
    </ul>
