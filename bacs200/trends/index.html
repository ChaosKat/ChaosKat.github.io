        <p>
            Katherine Haney-Osborn, more commonly known as Katie, is a Software Engineering major from Longmont, Colorado. An ambitious, creative mind, she always tries her best 
            at whatever she tries to do. Her primary skills are writing, typing, and singing all of which she has many years of experience in. When looking at world problems she
