        <h1>Economic Recovery Post-Pandemic</h1>
        <p>
            When COVID-19 first ravaged the world in March of 2021 there was a massive economic uproar. Millions of people were laid off or fired, unemployment skyrocketed, and 
            many small businesses were forced to close. Since then the US has been slowly recovering, and in the past few months we've even seen some statistics return to 
            pre-pandemic levels. We can also see some potential permanent consequences of the pandemic, such as the decline of movie theaters and decreased credit card spending. 
            In all areas, COVID-19 at the very least halted progress and growth for a year before returning to normal, and that's the best case scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            One area which has seen excellent recovery from COVID-19 is in unemployment rates. From March to May of 2020 unemployment skyrocketed to 23 million, but have made an
            impressive recovery in 2021. Current unemployment rates have even fallen below pre-pandemic levels, going from 2 million in January 2020 to 1.5 million now. The layoff 
            rate make a quicker recovery than most, being back to mostly normal levels by May of 2020, but quiting rates have been steadily rising throughout the pandemic. Job 
            opprotunities have experienced massive spikes as we've returned to a less pandemic run state, likely due to many companies needing to hire employees after losing so many 
            during 2020. While the DOW, which measures the stock market, has been steadily rising above pre-pandemic levels since even early pandemic, investors have become more fear 
            driven overall, though the data is quite jumpy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with things returning to normal, other economic factors are looking to have been permanently changed by the pandemic. Two big examples are small business closure and 
            online shopping. Unfortunately since many small businesses were forced to close permanently by the pandemic, we can never truly recover from the loss experienced in this 
            area. While new businesses will take their place over time it will likely take years if not a decade or two to return to pre-pandemic levels in some states such as Florida 
            and Texas. Online shopping on the other hand, is booming thanks to the pandemic. With so many physical stores being closed, online shopping became the only option for 
            most people, leading to many families realizing the convience and value lying within the practice. This particular economic area has been rising during the pandemic and is 
            retaining its gains into 2021.
        </p>

            Discussing economic recovery from COVID-19 is a complex topic. Many different sectors will be affected, and all in their own unique ways. The movie theater complex 
            in particular has yet to recover from the pandemic, still being at about half of previous levels. May it still make a comeback? Perhaps, but the rise of video streaming 
            platforms may make the pandemic the first step in a nail to the coffin of theater success. Other sectors have returned to a relative normalcy and some, particularly online 
            ventures, have benefited. It will likely take decades for the full effects of the pandemic to truly show themselves, but even this early on there's an undeniable impact.
