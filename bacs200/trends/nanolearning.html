        <h1>Nanolearning - Learning New Skills in just a Few Minutes</h1>
        <p>The nanolearning approach to education is based on the modern Internet. From five minute Youtube history videos to tweets, experts have noticed how learning online 
            is done in a quick, straight to the point manor that has allowed for a much more rapid dispursal of information that once took years to teach the general public. 
            This unique style of learning has since been adapted into nanolearning, which is based around these online practices. Its emergence and growth has also been motivated 
            by decreasing attention spans and the growing desire for efficency in a world where the difference between 6 and 8 hours of work can be fatal.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it is not a perfect form of learning by any means. Nanolearning specializes in delivering simple, straight forward messages, with more complex ideas requiring more structured 
            nanolearning courses, kind of like a Twitter thread. Even considering this possibility though, at some point the complexity will be such that sticking to this method would 
            take longer than it would otherwise. More complex ideas are still better taught by a more professional institution like a college, which is why those things still exist. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Nanolearning is more of a supliment to future learning, but it's an important one. Concepts that would take hours to fully teach in a professional institution can be taught in a few minutes 
            by nanolearning, cutting out information unneeded by the audience in order to create a more efficient environment. This method also empthasizes attention grabbing strategies 
            in order to get the audience engaged quickly, which can help those who may have trouble focusing be able to grasp the material on a level they couldn't before. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Nanolearning is shaping up to be an important part of our future education system. It's an example of how taking inspiration from the modern web can lead to new, innovative 
            practices in a number of unexpected fields. This new style of learning offers a great solution to any business or instition that needs to teach fast and efficently, and 
            it will no doubt continue to grow in the coming years.
