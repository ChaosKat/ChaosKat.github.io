        <h1>Veganism - The Benefits and the Concerns</h1>
        <p>
            Veganism is by no means a new phenomenon- it started all the way back in 1944 when a small group of vegetarians split off from the movement in order to create a much more 
            demanding one. While vegetarians only choose to abstain from meat, vegans will not consume any meat or animal products, both in diet and other areas of life. A common 
            misconception is that veganism is stickly vegetarianism but also excluding animal products, but in reality it's much more than that. Veganism is a political movement 
            and a lifestyle which not only doesn't participate in but actively fights against anything that they see as animal cruelity. I say "that they see" as there are numerous 
            disagreements within the vegan community about what is and isn't allowed and the level to which they apply their ideology to their lives and the lives of others. Veganism 
            is a complex political topic as it relies heavily on one's own interpretation of morality and ethics, and where you land on these topics will vastly impact how you see the 
            movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vegans typically have three primary concerns regarding the use of animal products- ethics, health, and environment. They argue that modern farming is grossly unethical in 
            the name of profit, but some will also argue that no ethical form of animal farming exists and that the practice itself must be abolished. Adding to this is the environmental 
            impact of these farms, particularly dairy and beef ones, is quite staggering. Agriculture as a whole accounts for 24% of c02 emissions worldwide, with cows alone being 
            25% of this impact. Vegan diets also lead to weight loss and lower the rates of a number of harmful diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The current conditions of livestock 
            farming are undeniable, and it's admirable that vegans take a stance against this abuse. But does going vegan truly help the environment and the animals living in it?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is helpful- if you can do it. Vegan diets present a number of unique health concerns that, if not considered properly, can lead to many horrible diseases stemming from 
            deficencies in various important vitamins and minerals. This presents an additional monitary concern- not only are you paying for vegan food which may be more expensive, 
            but you might also have to pay for vitamin suppliments which are very expensive. Common suppliment needs include Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Iron, and Zinc, but there can be 
            even more. All of this stands as a counter argument to a common claim among vegans- that anyone can do it and that humans can live naturally off a plant based diet. The 
            reality is that humans are omnivores- we evolved in consideration of a diet consisting of both plants and animals- and when you sacrifice one of those two areas problems 
            will naturally arise. So while veganism is helpful for the environment and supports animal rights, looking down on those who are not vegan isn't okay by any means.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being a pretty radical political movement, it's also important to consider the consequences of that. Like any activist group, vegans protest for what they advocate for, 
            in this case animal rights, the adoption of vegan diets among more people, and environmental protection. All well and good, but sometimes their demands go quite far beyond 
            what most would consider probable or even ethical. Extreme vegan beliefs range from the abolition of pet ownership, to the extiniction of all domesticated animals on Earth. 
            The latter may come as quite a surprise- aren't vegans fighting tooth and nail for the rights of these very creatures? Such can be the consequence of such extremist thinking- 
            it can blind you to even your original goal. Some former vegans were so hurt by the movements more extreme beliefs that they have gone so far as to say veganism is a cult, 
            which isn't exactly a good look for any movement, especially a left leaning one. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Veganism is complex as to what extent it can solve the problems it advocates against. The fact is that even taking money out of the equation, the health risks of veganism 
            make it an unviable option for many, meaning that veganism in and of itself cannot solve animal cruelity. However, many vegans are out educating on animal rights issues and 
            doing important legislative work in making livestock farming more ethical, which often decreases the environmental impact by itself. Yet the voices of radical vegans cannot 
            be ignored either- not only would killing off domesticated animals be extremely labor intensive, traumatizing, and heartbreaking for many pet owners, but it puts the health 
            of future humans and animals in danger. The vegan community will need to truly consider the best compromise between animal rights and human health in order to reach the 
            best outcome, but if they can do this they'd likely become a formidable force in the face of animal abuse of all kinds, and that's something to hope for.
