        <h1>Quantum Computing - The Future of Computer Science</h1>
        <p>
            Quantum Computers are a new and very promising innovation in computing technology. They're created through use of the science of quantum mechanics, which aims to study
            the Universe on the smallest scale- atomic and subatomic. The world of quantum mechanics is quite different from our own in ways that may seem contradictory, however this 
            blog does not aim to explain the concept. The important thing to know is that quantum mechanics allows for us to create incredibly small, efficent, and powerful computers 
            that aren't possible otherwise.

            In order to understand the true value of quantum computing, we must compare it to what we have now. The two primary types of computers in use today are traditional or
            classical computers, the kind most people have in their homes, and supercomputers, used by scientists and engineers to solve complex problems which require much more energy
            and computing power than the average computer has. However, even supercomputers have their limits, oftentimes much more limiting than we would like. That's where the power 
            of quantum computers comes in. Using the science of quantum mechanics, these computers are built to handle these complex problems that we'd otherwise be forced to do manually.

            A technology of this scale might bring forth energy concerns- many complex technologies such as bit-coin have a massive energy use that makes them impractical to use without 
            more or less destroying the environment. Fortunately quantum computers are very efficent. Not only can they perform more complex computations than supercomputers, but they use 
            less energy in the process. The entire process is quite complex, so see the sources at the bottom of the page to read about it from IBM, a leading developer in the quantum 
            field.

            Quantum computing is a field with high potential in almost all areas of life. There's no doubt that as these machines develop it'll lead to a massive innovation in the 
            tech field, but there can be downsides. Any piece of powerful technology has the potential to do great harm in the wrong hands, but it's important to keep in mind that 
            the people with these less savory ambitions are few and far between. Quantum computing is capable of so much, and many big companies are already taking advantage of the 
            technology in projects such as developing like electric cars and solving energy crises throughout the world. If used correctly, quantum computing can change the world.
