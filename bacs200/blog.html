                    Political Extremism can seriously harm society at large, regardless of whether it's left or right. Terrorist attacks in particular are specifically linked to 
                    political extremism, being defined by attacker intent to further a political goal through distruction and harm. Even outside of terrorism however, extremists 
                    tend to be more likely to use violence or other dangerous methods to achieve their goals. The January riot at the White House is real world proof of this- 
                    in fact the impetus for this attack was through Donald Trump calling for a rally at the White House via Twitter.
