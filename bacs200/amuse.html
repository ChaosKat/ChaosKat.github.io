<h1>Strangely funny things on the Internet</h1>
<p style="color:indigo">By Katie Haney-Osborn</p>
<p>A collection of very bizarre Internet occurances that are probably funny</p>

<h2>Battle of B-R5RB</h2>
<p>The Battle of B-R5RB is an in game battle in the MMO Eve Online, theorized to be the largest PvP battle in gaming history back when it occured in 2016.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_B-R5RB">There's even a Wikipedia article written about it</a>
<p>This entire battle occured due to a single player missing their matinence payment, thus opening the entire Star System to attack</p>

<p>It's also estimated to have incured about three hundred thousand real USD from in game damages and destruction of various ships</p>
<p>Everything about this video game battle is really funny to me. From the reason it occured to the fact that people took it seriously enough to sacrifice thousands of dollars
worth of items to win, but it's also super interesting and shows just how big video games have become</p>

<h2>The fastest Undertale speedruns</h2>
<p>If you've spent any amount of time on the Internet it's highly likely you've heard of the hit Indie game Undertale, released in 2015 by Toby Fox. 
A typical playthrough of Undertale takes about 10 hours</p>
<a href="https://www.speedrun.com/undertalecategoryextensions#Debug_Mode">Yet if you look on the category extension page for Undertale speedruns, you'll find a seemingly impossible display</a>
<p>These are Undertale debug mode runs. By taking advantage of various debug commands, runners can complete the game in about a second</p>
<p>I would tell you more about these runs, but they're so fast I can't tell what's going on. Regardless, they are extremely funny</p>
