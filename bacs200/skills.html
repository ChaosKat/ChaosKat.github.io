                        <h3>Part One - My Current Status</h3>
                        <p>I created a list of skills relevant to Web Design and freelancing and put them into three general categories of experience</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group One - Zero Confidence</h4>
                        <h6>Skills that I have so little experience in that I'd be embarassed to use them in a professional setting</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Java Script - Novice - Literally have no experience</li>
                            <li>Accessibility - Novice - I know the basics but have basically no experience putting it into practice or prioritizing it</li>
                            <li>UX/Tone - Novice - I put tone in there because otherwise I wouldn't know what it means</li>
                            <li>Team Management - Novice - I managed a team for a month long class, which is why it's at the top of the novice skills</li>
                            <li>Marketing - Beginner - The persuasive techniques I've learned from writing argumenative essays have flowed into some surprisingly intelligent marketing by me in the past. Still have almost no experience though</li>
                            <li>11 Efficiency (In Web Design) - Beginner - The ability to create pages fast. Learning web design has caused some of these time saving techniques to follow</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Two - Yeah I Can Do This Thing</h4>
                        <h6>Skills I've used enough to be confident showing the results to others, although am still hesitant to use in a professional setting</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bootstrap - Beginner - I can understand it to an extent, but it's still pretty low for me</li>
                            <li>Graphic Design - Beginner - Despite having a solid idea of what looks good my lacking artistic abilities lead to it looking generally bland anyway</li>
                            <li>HTML - Beginner - I've used some HTML before this class, but taking it really taught me a lot</li>
                            <li>CSS - Beginner - Basically on the same level as HTML for me</li>
                            <li>Business - Beginner - Probably my least favorite skill on this list, but I can do it to an extent</li>
                            <li>Time Management - Competent - When you procrastinate as much as me you learn a lot about managing time under tight schedules</li>
                            <li>Video Editing - Competent - At first I did it out of necessity, and then I just started doing it for no real reason. It's just fun to do</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Three - Heck Yeah This is Awesome</h4>
                        <h6>Skills I feel confident enough to publish in and show off</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team Cooperation - Competent - I love being told exactly what to do and then mindlessly completing it, but brainstorming with others is also fun</li>
                            <li>Communication - Competent - Writing a lot will naturally improve your communication skills to an extent, and I feel I've gotten much better at articulating myself over the past couple years</li>
                            <li>Grammar - Proficient - Is it perfect? No. Do I make many mistakes? Also no. I'm at the point where I know when to drop correct grammar to make an impact</li>
                            <li>Writing - Proficient - There are two productive skills I consider to be hobbies for me- writing and programming. Out of the two, writing is the one I'm actually good at</li>
                            <li>Punctuation - Expert - I can't remember the last time I failed to capitalize an I</li>
                            <li>Typing - Expert - I could probably sell my typing skills by themselves. I average around 80 to 90 words a minute, can type without looking at the keyboard or the screen, and do it every single day</li>
                        </ul>
