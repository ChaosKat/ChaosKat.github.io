                        <h3>Part One - My Current Status</h3>
                        <p>I created a list of skills relevant to Web Design and freelancing and put them into three general categories of experience</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group One - Zero Confidence</h4>
                        <p>Skills that I have so little experience in that I'd be embarassed to use them in a professional setting<p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Java Script - Novice - Literally have no experience</li>
                            <li>Accessibility - Novice - I know the basics but have basically no experience putting it into practice or prioritizing it</li>
                            <li>UX/Tone - Novice - I put tone in there because otherwise I wouldn't know what it means</li>
                            <li>Team Management - Novice - I managed a team for a month long class, which is why it's at the top of the novice skills</li>
                            <li>Marketing - Beginner - Some of my writing skills give me an edge in marketing, but I have little experience with it by itself</li>
                            <li>Efficiency (In Web Design) - Beginner - Learning web design has caused some time saving techniques to follow</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Two - Yeah I Can Do This Thing</h4>
                        <p>Skills I've used enough to be confident showing the results to others, although am still hesitant to use in a professional setting<p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bootstrap - Beginner - I can understand it to an extent, but it's still pretty low for me</li>
                            <li>Graphic Design - Beginner - Despite having a solid idea of what looks good my lacking artistic abilities lead to it looking generally bland anyway</li>
                            <li>HTML - Beginner - I've used some HTML before this class, but taking it really taught me a lot</li>
                            <li>CSS - Beginner - Basically on the same level as HTML for me</li>
                            <li>Business - Beginner - Probably my least favorite skill on this list, but I can do it to an extent</li>
                            <li>Time Management - Competent - When you procrastinate as much as me you learn a lot about managing time under tight schedules</li>
                            <li>Video Editing - Competent - At first I did it out of necessity, and then I just started doing it for no real reason. It's just fun to do</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Three - Heck Yeah This is Awesome</h4>
                        <p>Skills I feel confident enough to publish in and show off<p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team Cooperation - Competent - I love being told exactly what to do and then mindlessly completing it, but brainstorming with others is also fun</li>
                            <li>Communication - Competent - Writing a lot will naturally improve your communication skills to an extent, and I feel I've gotten much better at articulating myself over the past couple years</li>
                            <li>Grammar - Proficient - Is it perfect? No. Do I make many mistakes? Also no. I'm at the point where I know when to drop correct grammar to make an impact</li>
                            <li>Writing - Proficient - There are two productive skills I consider to be hobbies for me- writing and programming. Out of the two, writing is the one I'm actually good at</li>
                            <li>Punctuation - Expert - I can't remember the last time I failed to capitalize an I</li>
                            <li>Typing - Expert - I could probably sell my typing skills by themselves. I average around 80 to 90 words a minute, can type without looking at the keyboard or the screen, and do it every single day</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Part Two - What I Aim to Focus on</h3>
                        <p>Here I select the skills that I plan to focus on developing in the next six months</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group One</h4>
                        <p>As the skills in group one are in need of the most work, this is an important category in training</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team Management/Leadership</li>
                            <li>Accessibility</li>
                            <li>UX</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Two</h4>
                        <p>This group primarily involves the intersection between various aspects of programming in web design (efficiency can also be included here by proxy)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create web pages</li>
                            <li>Business</li>
                            <li>Graphic Design</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Three</h4>
                        <p>Since I enjoy the skills in this area I tend to improve them without needing an explicit plan</p>
                        <p>However I'll highlight communication and team cooperation, as they have the lowest experience in the group and require going out of my way to improve.</p>

                        <h3>Part Three - The Plan</h3>
                        <p>Highlighting the time I want to spend on each skill and what my overall objectives are</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group One</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Team Management - Next semester I'd like to take more leadership roles in my class projects. For most of this semester I've taken a back seat, 
                                but I believe I'm ready to voice my ideas and play a key role in work after my first experience in my month long class.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Accessibility - This section is less about research and more about practice. I want to do a web page project that is specifically difficult from an
                                accessibility perspective and try to figure it out. Along with this I want to reflect on the accessibility options on some of the web sites I use 
                                to see if there's anything that could be improved on. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                UX - I really need to figure out what this is and what it entails. As such most of my time with this skill will be research rather than practice, 
                                although I will try to incorperate what I learn into my web pages when I can.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Two</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Web Design - I've decided to title the combined skills of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap under web design, because they serve as the foundation for it. 
                                My big goal here is to get lots of experience- I want to create several web sites and challenges for myself so I can gain experience not only in the 
                                programming side, but in other related skills listed throughout this slideshow. I'd like to create a new web page every two weeks in order to keep my 
                                skills sharp. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Business - As I am part business major learning more about this skill is natural. But more than anything I'd like to learn to actually like business, 
                                or at least some aspect of it that I can focus on. This would help a lot in my career and be greatly appreciated in general.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Graphic Design - A large part of my web page projects will involve challenging myself to do more graphic design. This is one skill where I just need to 
                                do it and get better at in. Right now I'm being held back by my desire for perfect looking work, but I'll never improve with that kind of mindset. Therefore 
                                I will make it happen, even if it's tedious.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Group Three</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Communication Skills - I'd really like to work on building connections within my major and my dorm next semester. While I did well for a time, I ended 
                                up completely abandoning all forms of communication in November due to an illness, which has left me a bit behind on this front. I'd like to focus on 
                                the business aspect of connections in particular, mainly teaching myself that no, not all business motivated interactions are manipulative in nature. 
                                But even if I just make a couple good friends that'd be good with me.
                            </li>
